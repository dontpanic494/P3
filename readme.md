## Details for teaching team
The Lorem Ipsum generator and Random User Generator are pretty straight forward. The xkcd Password Generator works SUPER well from the programming side, however I implemented a new, locally stored dictionary which includes so many words that it seems more often than not you get unfamiliar words. I'd likely use a different library on another iteration - but again, it functions perfectly.

All tools are built to be mobile friendly, so they look and work great even on smartphones!

## Comments
This was an awesome project, and I learned a ton about working with MVC's. I can't wait to get started on my P4 application!
